# EconomySim

An attempt to create an economy simulation that can be used to drive questing in games.

## What is this???

Well to explain, the aim of this repository is to create a simulation of an economy that influences how NPCs in games act. This can be usefull for games that want to have side quests (or even main quests) mean something a little more than just 'Please egnore me, i give berly any xp' to 'Please egnore me, i give berly any xp but if you do then the vilage you are in may do slightly better'... \
well...\
that was a big difference...

Either way it also means that NPCs act in a more sensible way, if wood becomes incredibly valuable then more NPCs will start trying to sell wood. Players then also have to compeat with the AI in wood.

## Features

- Entitys that control NPCs/Companies in games, both managment and RPG
- Simulate the entire economy, from item value and Entity actions to interst and asset selling
